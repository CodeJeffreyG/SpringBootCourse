# Section 1.2: Starting a Maven Project and Serving an HTML Response

Welcome to Section 1.2 of the Spring Boot course! In this section, we learned essential concepts related to starting a Maven project, customizing server port configurations, and serving an HTML response with a Spring Boot application.

## What I've Learned

### 1. Creating a Maven Project
- We started by setting up a new Maven project, an essential tool for building and managing Java applications. Maven simplifies dependency management and project structure.

### 2. Configuring Server Port
- We explored how to customize the server port for our Spring Boot application. Understanding server port configuration is crucial for avoiding conflicts and aligning your application with specific requirements.

### 3. Serving an Index.html Response
- We built a basic Spring Boot application that serves an HTML response. Key takeaways include:
  - Creating a simple `index.html` file for content.
  - Defining a Spring Boot controller to handle incoming requests and return the HTML page.
  - Running the Spring Boot application and accessing the HTML page via a web browser.
