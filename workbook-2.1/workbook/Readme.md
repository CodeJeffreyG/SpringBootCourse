# Section 2.1: Using @Controller and @GetMapping for View Handling

Welcome to Section 2.1 of the Spring Boot course! In this section, we explored the fundamentals of using the `@Controller` annotation and the `@GetMapping` annotation to handle views in Spring Boot applications.

## What I've Learned

### 1. @Controller Annotation
- We delved into the `@Controller` annotation, an essential component in Spring Boot for defining controller classes.
- Key takeaways include:
  - Annotating a class with `@Controller` to designate it as a controller.
  - Understanding the role of a controller in handling HTTP requests and returning views.

### 2. @GetMapping Annotation
- We learned about the `@GetMapping` annotation, which maps HTTP GET requests to specific methods in a controller.
- Highlights of what we covered include:
  - Annotating controller methods with `@GetMapping` and specifying the URL path.
  - Utilizing `@GetMapping` to return HTML views stored in the `templates` folder.
